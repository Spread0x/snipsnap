# To be done on Friday 19.02.21:

Important:

- Handle user prompts
  - Figure out how to resolve deeply nested templates
- Add ability to provide settings to the extension

Side (if there would be enough time):

- Start refactoring `extension.js`: then -> await, modularize some fns
- Start writing a proper README
- Add `utils` module

Bonus:

- deploy the whole thing and publish to marketplace
