## üî• What problem Snipsnap is trying to solve?

Snipsnap Templates could help you create a flexible folder and file structures that you can easily recreate with just a few clicks using the [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snipsnapdev.snipsnap-templates-vscode).

Nowadays we spend a lot of time creating boilerplate code structures whether we work with **React** or **Devops** tools such as Kubernetes.

Check our [uses cases section](https://github.com/snipsnapdev/snipsnap/blob/master/templates/docs/use-cases.md) to see how Snipsnap can help you to boost your productivity.

Imagine you've just started your new project with React. Probably you will have the following structure for every new component:

```jsx
my-example
-- index.js
-- my-example.js
-- my-example.css
```
Each of those files will have a predictable boilerplate code structure based on the component name.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import styles from './my-example.css';
const MyExample = (props) => (
  <div className={cx('wrapper')}>
  </div>
)
MyExample.propTypes = {
};
MyExample.defaultProps = {
};
export default MyExample;
```

`index.js` file will have just an import of that component

```jsx
export { default } from "./my-example";
```

The example above is a simple scenario however it could easily go beyond that by having

```jsx
my-example
-- index.js
-- my-example.js
-- my-example.container.js
-- my-example.stories.js
-- my-example.css
```

We have several options to manage it:

- Create every file and folder from scratch one by one;
- Copy and paste folders and files from other places and replace names where necessary
- Create files and folders from scratch, but then use code snippets to fill the content inside those files with boilerplate constructions.

All of these options require a lot of actions and can't prevent you from having just simple mistakes over copy-pasting or typos.

That where **Snipsnap Templates** starts to shine.

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works?

With a simple [Cloud UI](https://templates.snipsnap.dev/) and [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snipsnapdev.snipsnap-templates-vscode) you can create **Code Templates** - sets of reproducible file/folder structures boosted with template engine.

To create a template:

- Drop files into Cloud file browser
- Define user prompts(inputs) that the user will be asked to enter while using the template in VS Code (e.g., "Please type a component name") and assign their values to variables you can use with template engine
- Use variables within files and folders names or their content like `{{ componentName }}` or apply case conversion `{{toKebabCase componentName}}`
- Save the template. Now you could easily recreate it with the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snipsnapdev.snipsnap-templates-vscode). All your templates will be available from the context menu of your VS Code file browser under "Create from Template".

Once you've created a template, you can share it with your team, or make it publicly available so everyone could use it.

## ‚ö° Features

### Prompts

Define user prompts(inputs) and assign them to variables you can later use in your file/folder names and content.

### Template Engine Support

Snipsnap uses Handlebars so every user prompts could be accesible via template variables by using this `{{ componentName }}` syntax.
Also you can apply one of the case conversion helpers:

- toCamelCase
- toSnakeCase
- toKebabCase
- toUpperCase
- toLowerCase
- toPascalCase

Example usage: `{{ toCamelCase componentName}}`.

In the future we aim to add more helpers as well as a support of different variable types for prompts, so you will be able to use more complicated conditional logic or loop iterations in your templates.

### Groups

Organize your code templates into groups by project, company, technology.

### Share

Use share button near with the Group or Template to give access to your friends or team members.

### Marketplace and Public templates

Make template publicly available if you think it could help someone to boost their productivity.
